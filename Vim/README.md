[_See all dotfiles_](https://github.com/sheharyarn/dotfiles)


## Installation

### Upgrade Vim

The default `vim` by Apple sucks balls, so we're going to upgrade to the latest Vim.
First, switch over to the system `ruby` if you're using `rvm`:

```bash
rvm use system
```

Use Homebrew to install `vim`:

```bash
brew install vim --override-system-vim
```

### Install MacVim

```bash
brew install  macvim
brew linkapps macvim
```

### Install [NeoVim](http://neovim.io/)

Let's take advantage of the Dark Features

```bash
# Install NeoVim
brew install neovim/neovim/neovim

# And the python modules (or use pip2 / pip3)
pip install neovim
```

You can also install the unofficial GUIs ([VimR](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr) /
[neovim-dot-app](https://github.com/rogual/neovim-dot-app)):

```bash
brew install rogual/neovim-dot-app/neovim-dot-app --HEAD
brew linkapps neovim-dot-app
```

## Configuration

Once everything is installed, symlink the vim dotfiles and create the required directories:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_backup
mkdir -p ~/.vim/swap ~/.vim/backups ~/.config/nvim ~/.SpaceVim.d/

ln -s ~/.dotfiles/Vim/main.vim      ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/Vim/colors        ~/.vim/colors
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/Vim/spacevim.vim  ~/.SpaceVim.d/init.vim

ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

<br>


## Plugins

I use [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) for Plugin Management (Previously
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)). It's fast and leverages new features
in Vim 8.0 and NeoVim:

1. Install Dein

    ```bash
    $ curl -fsSL https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim/raw/master/bin/installer.sh > dein.sh
    $ sh ./dein.sh ~/.vim/dein
    ```

2. Make sure your `vimrc` dotfiles are set up

3. The plugins would be auto-installed on start

    ```vim
    " But you can manually install them
    :call dein#install()

    " Or force update them
    :call dein#update()
    ```

_(If you're using Spacevim, use its built-in plugin management system)_

### Plugins that require extra work:

 - [**Airline**](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/)

    If you are using `vim-airline`, you need to use fonts that have been patched for
    powerline in your terminal. Here are a few patched fonts that I use in my OSX
    [Terminal Themes](https://github.com/sheharyarn/dotfiles/tree/master/OSX/Terminal):

      - [Menlo for Powerline](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline)
      - [Powerline Patched Font-Pack](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/)
      - [Nerd Patched Font-Pack](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for extra symbols

    If you don't find your desired font patched with the Powerline Icons,
    [you'll have to patch it manually](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/tree/develop/fontpatcher).

 - [**You Complete Me**](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)

    If you're not using NeoComplete / Deoplete and YCM instead, use Vim v7.4 or greater;
    [On OSX, You can do this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14511970/1533054).
    It has a compiled component as well. You'll need to set it up for it to work properly.
    [Installation instructions found here](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/).


### SpaceVim

If you want to use SpaceVim instead of manually managing your plugins and configs, you can do that.
These dotfiles work perfectly with SpaceVim:

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash -s -- -h
```

After it is installed, make sure to enable SpaceVim at the top of `main.vim`:

```vim
let g:spacevim_enabled = 1
```
