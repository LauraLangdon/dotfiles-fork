Android Studio
==============

Install it using [Homebrew Cask](http://github.com/sheharyarn/dotfiles/tree/master/Homebrew):

```bash
brew cask install android-studio
```

## SDK

Install the SDK separately, and point Android Studio to its location. Ideally you'll keep a backup of your Monolithic SDK Folder, so you don't
have to download and install all 15 gigs of cringe every time you set it up on a new machine.

## settings.jar

This is an export of all my settings, keymaps, shortcuts, IDE preferences, Git configurations and other shit that I've customized to make
my experience with Android Studio better. Simply import these into Android Studio and you are good to go.
