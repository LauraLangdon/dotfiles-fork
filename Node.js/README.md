Node.js
=======

## Installation

```bash
$ brew install node
```

## Node Dev Tools

Run this script once to install different npm based developer tools:

```bash
$ source ~/.dotfiles/Node.js/node-dev-tools.sh
```

## Aliases

If you're using my dotfiles (including my .zshrc), these will get automatically loaded,
or you can load them manually by putting this in your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.dotfiles/Node.js/aliases.sh
```
