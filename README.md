sheharyarn's dotfiles
=====================

Inspired by [Ryan Bates'](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) and [Zach Holfman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) Dotfiles. For more information check out [Github Does Dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/) and [Dotfiles are meant to be Forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

I've now jumped ship to [OH MY ZSH!](http://ohmyz.sh/), my old Bash configurations are in [this branch](https://github.com/sheharyarn/dotfiles/tree/bash).
